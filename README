Versioning

This project strives to provide simple way to manage changes to
database.

Instead of making changes on development server, then finding
differences between production and development, deciding which ones
should be installed on production, and finding a way to install them -
you start with writing diffs themselves!

More detailed description is (so far) in here:

To install versioning simply run install.versioning.sql in your database
(all of them: production, stage, test, devel, ...).
